## Description
------

A simple Express.JS based note app that able to take notes and save them and delete eisting notes. 

## Installation

To install necessary dependencies, run the following command:

```
npm i express, then run node server.js to run app

```


## About

This app is a  digital node made with Express.JS backend as its main theme. The idea of this app is to link the HTML page to the backend server that will communicate with a db file, storing all of the saved notes as a JSON format and establishing express pathing.

The functionality of this app relies on the GET, POST, and DELETE methods. The Get method was pretty straightforward as all I had to do was connect the current directory with the files and data stored within files in the same directory.
